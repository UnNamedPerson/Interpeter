# Interpeter
This is my own personal project of creating a simple interpeter. I am following the guide in this blog (https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/).

This project is work on progress. hopefully by the end of it, I will have a complete working interpeter.

## 12/7/19 update: I created a scanner that can scan for addtion and subtraction of two numbers.
